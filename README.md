# ha-lumagen

Home Assistant custom integration for a [Lumagen Radiance Pro](https://www.lumagen.com/) video processor.

This integration is a thin wrapper over [`aiolumagen`](../aiolumagen). All protocol work — parsing, state tracking, commands — lives in the library; the integration adds HA lifecycle, entities, and a config flow.

```

The ESPHome bridge ([`esphome-lumagen`](../esphome-lumagen)) exposes the Lumagen's USB-B serial port to Home Assistant via ESPHome's `serial_proxy` component. When you adopt the ESPHome device in HA, HA automatically lists its serial proxies alongside any physical `/dev/tty*` ports. This integration's config flow presents that list as a dropdown — no host/PSK fields to fill in.

Direct RS-232 (cabled from your HA host to the Lumagen's DB9) also works — the same dropdown will show the `/dev/tty*` entry.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant **2026.5** or newer (native serial_proxy surfacing in the `usb` integration)
- The [`esphome-lumagen`](../esphome-lumagen) firmware on a Waveshare ESP32-S3-POE-ETH (or a direct RS-232 cable)
- The ESPHome integration adopted in HA for the bridge device (if going the ESPHome route)
- Network connectivity between HA and the bridge

## Installation

### HACS (once added to a repo)

1. HACS → Integrations → menu → Custom repositories → add `https://github.com/frankrosano/ha-lumagen` as type *Integration*.
2. Install **Lumagen Radiance Pro**.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/lumagen` into your HA config directory's `custom_components/`.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

## Setup

1. Settings → Devices & services → **Add integration** → search for **Lumagen Radiance Pro**.
2. From the dropdown, pick the serial port for the Lumagen. ESPHome-proxied ports appear with their friendly name ("Lumagen") plus the bridge's hostname; physical ports appear with their `/dev/tty*` path.
3. The flow opens the port, queries `ZQS01` for the device info, and creates the config entry with the detected model and firmware in the title.

### A note on `aioesphomeapi`

This integration requires plain `aiolumagen`, deliberately **not**
`aiolumagen[esphome]`. The ESPHome serial transport needs `aioesphomeapi`, but
Home Assistant already ships it — pinned exactly — for its own ESPHome
integration, and installs custom-integration requirements into the same
site-packages. If `aiolumagen` also declared it (necessarily at a looser
range), the resolver could move HA's pinned version; because `aioesphomeapi`
is a Cython package, that leaves mismatched `.so` files behind and breaks the
ESPHome integration with errors like `APIConnection size changed` or
`does not export expected C function make_noise_packets`.

Nothing is lost: an `esphome://` URL means you're using the ESPHome
integration, which provides the package. HA stays its single owner.

## Lumagen-side prerequisite: unsolicited reporting

For real-time updates rather than polling, enable Full v5 reporting on the Lumagen:

1. On the Lumagen remote or OSD, press `MENU`.
2. Navigate: **Other → I/O Setup → RS-232 Setup → Report mode changes**.
3. Cycle to **Full v5**.
4. Press `OK`, then `SAVE` to persist.

The integration works either way; this just makes it snappier. Leaving it at **Full v4** also works — those pushes still parse — you just don't get power and memory changes in real time.

Separately, note that Full v5 is a **firmware requirement**, not just a menu preference: `aiolumagen` polls status exclusively with `ZQI25`, so firmware predating it isn't supported. A device on such firmware won't show an error, its status sensors simply stay unknown; the library logs a warning at startup when it detects that case.

## Exposed entities

- **Binary sensors**: Power, HDR active, Auto aspect detection (diagnostic), Display supports Rec.2020 (diagnostic), Serial connected (diagnostic)
- **Sensors** (diagnostic): Model, Firmware, HDR source max/min luminance, HDR source MaxCLL
- **Sensors** (primary): Current input, Input memory, Source/Output resolution, Source/Output refresh rate (Hz), Source/Content aspect, Colorspace (enum), HDR status (enum), Input status (enum), Source mode (enum: Interlaced / Progressive / No input)
- **Buttons**: Power on/Standby, full OSD nav (Menu/Exit/OK/Menu off/Up/Down/Left/Right), direct inputs 1–8 + Previous, all aspect presets (4:3, Letterbox, 16:9, 16:9 NZ, 1.85, 2.35, 2.40), Auto aspect on/off, Redetect aspect, Memory A–D, HDR setup, Test pattern, OSD on/off, Save to NVRAM, Query status
- **Selects**: Input (1–8), Aspect ratio (7 options), Memory (A–D), Sharpness sensitivity (Normal/High), Subtitle shift (Off/Small/Large), HDR gamma mode (Auto/HDR/SDR)
- **Switches**: Sharpness, Game mode
- **Numbers**: Sharpness level (0–7), Minimum fan speed (0–9), HDR mapping max nits (0 to disable; 50–10000 to set display peak)
- **Update**: Firmware — offers new Radiance Pro firmware from lumagen.com and installs it (see below)

## Firmware updates

The **Firmware** update entity watches Lumagen's [release page](https://www.lumagen.com/software-updates/radiance-pro-updates) and can install a new release from Home Assistant.

> **Use at your own risk.** This is an independent, reverse-engineered implementation with no association with or endorsement by Lumagen, Inc. It has been tested on one Radiance Pro 4242. Read the [aiolumagen firmware warning](https://github.com/frankrosano/aiolumagen#firmware-updates) before your first install.

- **Checking.** The release page is checked once a day. The updater zip (~3 MB) is downloaded only when you press **Install**, and is handled in memory. Disable the entity to stop all checks.
- **Channel.** Set under the integration's **Configure** options. **Beta** (the default) offers the newest release of any label, since Lumagen rarely posts Production builds; "Production candidate" counts as beta. **Production** offers only releases labelled Production.
- **Standby.** If the Lumagen is in standby when you install, it's powered on automatically, given 15 seconds to finish starting up, and then updated.
- **The unit powers off at the end of a successful update. That's expected**: it's how the Lumagen loads new firmware. Power is then restored to how it was: if it was on, it's powered back on; if it was off, it's left off.
- **During the update** every other Lumagen entity shows as unavailable and the `lumagen.*` services refuse. The update entity shows progress. A section-0-only update takes about a minute; one that also rewrites section 1 takes about five.
- **Don't restart Home Assistant or reload the integration while an update is running.** Changing the integration's options mid-update is safe: the reload waits until the update finishes.
- **If an update fails**, read the message and retry before power-cycling the unit. An update that stops before touching live firmware leaves it unchanged.

### Qualify the transfer first

Updates from Home Assistant travel over its own ESPHome connection, which hasn't been qualified on hardware the way the aiolumagen command-line harness has. Before your first real install, run **`lumagen.qualify_firmware_transfer`** (admin only) several times. It runs the whole pipeline — download, power-on if needed, transfer, verify — but writes only the scratch region and never promotes it, so live firmware is untouched and the unit isn't powered down. Each run posts a notification with the flush statistics; retries should stay at zero.

## Service

- `lumagen.send_raw_command` — send any RS-232 command directly to the Lumagen. Useful for advanced features that aren't surfaced as entities (e.g. HDR test-pattern info frames during calibration). Pass `command` and optional `cr` (most `ZY`-prefixed commands need `cr: true`).
- `lumagen.qualify_firmware_transfer` — admin only. Exercise the firmware transfer path through Home Assistant, writing the scratch region only. See [Qualify the transfer first](#qualify-the-transfer-first).
