"""Firmware-update orchestration: download, power handling, session, restore.

Shared by the update entity (a real install) and the
``lumagen.qualify_firmware_transfer`` service (the same pipeline with
``promote=False, only=["section0"]``, which writes the scratch region only).

Every Lumagen-shaped operation — unpacking the zip, parsing the updater,
deciding what to write, the transfer itself — is a call into
:mod:`aiolumagen.firmware`. This module owns only the Home Assistant half:
HTTP, the order things happen in, the client pause/resume around the
session, power handling, and how outcomes are presented.

The sequence, and why it's in this order:

1. Download and unpack *before* touching the device, so a bad download or a
   mismatched archive costs nothing.
2. If the unit is in standby, power it on and let it settle — the updater
   refuses standby, and a unit that has only just reported "on" may still be
   coming up.
3. Gate the other entities, stop the client (``serial_proxy`` serves one
   subscriber), run the session on the entry's own URL, verbatim.
4. Restart the client, restore power to how the user left it, lift the gate.
   A reload, when needed, is scheduled last so it can't tear down the update
   entity while this is still running.
