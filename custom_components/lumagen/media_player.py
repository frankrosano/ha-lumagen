"""Media player for the Lumagen Radiance Pro.

The Lumagen is a video processor between sources and a display — no media
transport, no volume. But its defining control *is* input switching, which is
exactly what a media_player's ``source`` / ``source_list`` model expresses.
Modelling it this way puts power + input on one media card and enables voice
control ("turn on the Lumagen", "set Lumagen source to Input 3").

Only ``TURN_ON`` / ``TURN_OFF`` / ``SELECT_SOURCE`` are advertised, so cards
don't render volume sliders or transport buttons the device can't honor.

Source selection is genuinely bidirectional: unlike aspect (which the Lumagen
never reports as an active preset), the current input *is* reported via
``!I24`` / ``!I25``, so ``source`` reflects real device state rather than an
optimistic guess.

The Lumagen isn't "playing media" itself, but it *does* report live
statistics about the signal passing through it. We surface that on the media
card the way any player surfaces "now playing": the source->output signal
path is mapped onto ``media_title`` (the card's bold primary line) and the
HDR/colorspace summary onto ``app_name`` (which the frontend's
``computeMediaDescription`` renders as the secondary line when
``media_content_type`` is left unset). Both are gated on power so a stale
signal path never lingers on the card when the device is in standby.

The same fields also ride along as extra state attributes — that's the
full, unformatted mirror shown in the more-info dialog. The authoritative
per-field entities remain the individual sensors; the card fields and
attributes here are a convenience view.
