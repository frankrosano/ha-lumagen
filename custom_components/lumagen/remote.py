"""Remote for the Lumagen Radiance Pro.

Exposes the Lumagen's command surface as a Home Assistant ``remote`` entity —
the idiomatic home for OSD navigation (Menu / OK / arrows / Exit) and any
one-shot command, driven from automations via ``remote.send_command``.

``send_command`` accepts friendly command names (see ``_COMMANDS``) and, for
anything not in that map, falls through to sending the token as a raw wire
command. So ``remote.send_command(command="menu")`` and
``remote.send_command(command=["down", "down", "ok"])`` both work, as does a
raw ``remote.send_command(command="i3")``. ``num_repeats`` and ``delay_secs``
are honored, so "press down three times" is a single call.

This mirrors the media_player + remote dual-entity pattern used by Apple TV /
Android TV: the media_player owns power + source, the remote owns command
sending. Power is exposed on both (turn_on/turn_off here map to the same
``%`` / ``$`` commands) so either entity can wake the device.

Raw pass-through sends *without* a carriage return. Commands that require a CR
(most ``ZY…`` calibration commands) should use the ``send_raw_command``
service, which takes an explicit ``cr`` flag — the remote deliberately doesn't
guess at CR handling.
