    Returning ``None`` means "fall back to the entity's optimistic value",
    which covers both knobs the Lumagen never reports (HDR gamma mode) and
    ones it reports only on some firmware (subtitle shift).

    ``select_fn`` is given the client AND a snapshot of state at write
    time. State access is needed by compound-write commands like
    ``set_sharpness`` that must preserve other components' values.

    Note the optimistic fallback is per-entity and in-memory, so it resets to
    "unknown" on restart for anything the device won't report back.

    ``select_fn`` is ``None`` for the entries whose write path
    :meth:`LumagenSelect.async_select_option` handles itself (the
    compound ZY521 / ZY417 commands, which need coordinator state rather
    than just the client). ``None`` rather than a stand-in callable so a
    mismatch between the override branch and the descriptor surfaces as a
    loud failure instead of quietly dispatching the wrong command.

# selects a mismatched preset (e.g. 4:3 on 16:9 content) the display will
# be wrong until they pick another preset. Protocol limitation, not a bug.
#
# Every *numeric* ratio offered in the dropdown needs an entry here, or picking
# it would immediately snap the shown value to a neighbour: with 2.10 offered
# but unmapped, selecting it on 2.10 content would read back as "2.00" or
# "2.20". The test suite asserts the two tables agree on that set.
#
# Letterbox and 16:9 NZ are deliberately absent: they're framing/zoom variants
