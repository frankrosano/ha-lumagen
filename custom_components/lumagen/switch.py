"""Switches for the Lumagen Radiance Pro.

Three switches today:

* **Sharpness enabled** — toggles the Lumagen's edge-enhancement on/off.
  The underlying ``ZY521ELS`` command is compound (enabled + level +
  sensitivity), so flipping this switch reads the *current* level and
  sensitivity from coordinator state and writes them back unchanged
  alongside the new enabled bit. If level/sensitivity haven't been
  observed yet (e.g. first boot before ``ZQI30`` lands), we fall back to
  ``level=4`` and ``sensitivity="N"`` — sensible defaults that won't
  surprise the user.
* **Game mode** — single-bit ``ZY551X`` toggle, no compound write needed.
* **Auto aspect detection** — toggles the Lumagen's automatic aspect-ratio
  detection (``~`` on / ``V`` off). Unlike game mode it has no dedicated
  ``set_*`` wrapper on the client, so the write goes through
  ``send_command`` followed by a ``ZQI54`` re-query — auto-aspect isn't
  part of the Full v5 push stream, so state has to be pulled back. This
  replaces the old on/off buttons + read-only binary sensor with a single
  stateful control.

    No follow-up query, unlike ``_set_game_mode``. Auto aspect *does* ride the
    Full v5 push at payload index 26, and the device emits an unsolicited
    ``!I25`` on every auto-aspect change — verified on hardware by listening with
    no query outstanding. aiolumagen v0.10.0 feeds ``state.auto_aspect`` from that
    index, so the state arrives on its own and faster than a query would return
    it. The previous ``query_auto_aspect()`` here was redundant work.

    ``refresh=False`` because there is nothing to refresh: the push is the
